# Java-PHP-Javascript-Mysql CyberCafe

This program has a light structure and it is easy to use it, with simple UI.

I am using Java for client-side and PHP, Javascript, Mysql in the server-side.
In the client-side, the Java-Client program will be used to communicate with the server-side which is WebServer.

The server-side will use an Apache Server and the client will Make an Http Get Request every 5 seconds to send his status and read the command from the server as a result of the Request.

The Server can do many commands options to the client like turn it off or lock and und lock it.

The Server UI is simple and easy to use.
